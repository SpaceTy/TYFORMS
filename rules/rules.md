# TYSMP Rules

1. No griefing or stealing
- Stealing: taking something that isn't yours
- Griefing: damaging property that isn't yours. If it was an accident, ask the property owner if you should repair it, or how much you owe them for the damage

2. Be respectful to other players
- Do not bully, instigate conflict or harass other players
- Do not manipulate people into getting what you want
- Be polite and considerate of others, especially during debates

3. No cheating or using hacks 
- Freecam allowed if not used for finding structures or ores
- Minimap allowed if not used for finding structures or ores
- Worldmaps allowed
- Litematica allowed including easyplace, no printer addons
- Render distance expanders like Distant Horizons, or Bobby are allowed
- Tweakaroo and Minihud allowed
- If you are unsure about a mod ask @SpaceTy

4. Base looting is very circumstantial.
- Permanent ban = base IS free game
- Temporary ban = base is NOT free game
- If they share a base with someone else = base is NOT free game
- If they are on hiatus/taking a break = base is NOT free game
- Ping the property owner in the discord, or private message them to ask

5. Think before you act, stop when someone tells you to stop

6. Report rule breakers
- If you resolve conflict on your own but a clear rule was broken, inform staff
- Do not keep it a secret to hold against them later, see rule 2
- Do not keep it a secret because it didn't bother you, this encourages the behaviour to continue and puts other players at risk

7. Don't build too close to others without permission (if unsure ask moderators, or property owner)

8. Clean up creeper damage

9. No unwanted PvP, exercise friendly fire with caution (combat, traps, potions etc.)

10. Don't exploit glitches (if you are unsure if the glitch is allowed ask moderators or @SpaceTy)

11. Keep chat English only, swearing is allowed, vulgar language is not
- Main chat ingame and in discord. Private messages don't count
- If drama happens in another language all context and proof must be provided, translated individually by all parties involved separately from each other (all parties should create their own support ticket to discuss the conflict)
- This is to protect the safety and security of the community, and staff. If the only available staff cannot understand what is being said, that is unsafe.

12. Ask before using others' farms/resources
- If a farm is shared, to avoid drama all farm owners must agree when the farm is being shared to someone new, or have an agreement on how sharing should be handled.
- When a farm is shared and someone no longer wants to share the farm, and you cannot come to a conclusion on your own, create a ticket so staff can help.

13. Do not seek loopholes to justify breaking rules. It inherently breaks rules 2 and 5.

14. Obey discord ToS in discord

Always err on the side of caution, ask when unsure about a rule, if you are caught breaking a rule consequences will follow.
